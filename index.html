        <h3 class="ShortBio">A Short Bio About Me, Adrian Huebner</h3>
          <p class="ShortBio">I was born in Seattle, Washington on May 15, 1992. I am the oldest sibling, I only have 1 younger sister whose name is Kalynn and she is 1 year and 5 monthes younger than me. I have lived in Seattle my whole life and I grew up in the same house that my father grew up in.</p>
            <h4 class="AboutEducation">Education</h4>
              <p class="AboutEducation">I started my education at Christ the King, I private school that started with Preschool and continued on until 8th grade. I began my education there when I was 3-years-old and continued on until I graducated in 8th grade. From Christ the King I moved to Bishop Blanchet High School, again another private school. I graduated from Blanchet in the year 2010. At that time, my goal was to go into computer animation, however I didn't want to pay art school tution for the basics that I would need for a bachelors degree. So I chose to go to Edmonds Community College, where I earned my Associate of Arts degree. Upon finishing school, I was financially unable to afford contiuing my education at an art school, so I went into the job field. I bounced around different retail jobs for a while, when I ended up at Starbucks where I worked for 3 years when I decided that I wanted to finish my education. I can't remember how I happened up on, but I ended up taking the 101 calss at CodeFellows and fell in love but was unable to afford it at the time. A year later, I took 101 again to make sure that I still loved it, I did. And from there I continued on with my education.</p>
            <h4 class="Books">Where my Love of Reading Comes From</h4>
              <p class="Books">When I was in kindergarden, I had an extremely hard time learning how to read and my teachers were concered about how far behind I was, compared to other students. My father decided that he would work with me everynight and read to me. I don't know how he decided it, probably because you could buy a cheap multipack at Sam's or Costco, he chose to read me Nancy Drew. I don't know what it was about Nancy Drew but I ended up loving it, and we read the whole series together. It became a tradition, we then began to add Harry Potter. Even though I knew how to read at a certain point, there was something comforting about having him read to me.</p>
