            <h4 class="Books">Where my Love of Reading Comes From</h4>
              <p class="Books">When I was in kindergarden, I had an extremely hard time learning how to read and my teachers were concered about how far behind I was, compared to other students. My father decided that he would work with me everynight and read to me. I don't know how he decided it, probably because you could buy a cheap multipack at Sam's or Costco, he chose to read me Nancy Drew. I don't know what it was about Nancy Drew but I ended up loving it, and we read the whole series together. It became a tradition, we then began to add Harry Potter. Even though I knew how to read at a certain point, there was something comforting about having him read to me.</p>
